        <p>I'm a web developer with a background in engineering and data analysis. In Summer 2021, I finished a certificate in full stack development from Rutgers University, adding skills in JavaScript and the MERN Stack to add to my existing knowledge of SQL Server and Python.</p> 

        <p>A lifelong learner, I taught myself SQL to streamline data-gathering tasks for my engineering team. I contributed to building an energy efficiency recommendations engine in Python. My communication and collaboration skills are sharply honed from years working as an engineer and project manager.</p>

        <p>As a future full-stack or back-end developer, Iâ€™m excited to bring data-driven insights to end-users for a fast-paced and innovative company.</p>
